# smart-shelf-replenishment

*Smart Shelf which detects and notifies when the shelf is about to get empty. This is a common problem in shopping
stores where store manager doesn't have information of which shelf is about the get empty and should be refilled, leading
to substantial loss.*

*Changes are detected in real time and camera feed is being displayed on the dashboard with notifications*

**This project uses OpenCV for detection of available space on shelf**

## Example: 
In the given scenario below, **Screenshot 1** showcases the initial condition when the shelves are full.
Whereas **Screenshot 2** shows the change in space available column when few Cold drink cans are removed.
